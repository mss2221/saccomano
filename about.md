[Mark Saccomano](https://music.columbia.edu/bios/mark-saccomano) concentrates on phenomenological approaches to meaning and on developing a critical understanding of musical hermeneutics.  Specific areas of interest include attention and affect, listening and interpretation, and theoretical approaches to the study of acousmatic music. Current research focuses on late twentieth-century music and contemporary electronic works. Markâ€™s investigations in aesthetics and interpretation are informed by training in semiotics and semantics: in addition to an MA in music from Columbia, Mark holds a BA in linguistics with high honors from UC Berkeley and an MA in applied linguistics from UCLA.
