Mark&nbsp;Saccomano concentrates on phenomenological approaches to meaning in music and is studying the effects of timbre and texture on listeners’ perception of space. Specific areas of interest include music and affect, hermeneutics, and the aesthetics of recorded music. Current research focuses on late twentieth-century music and contemporary electronic works. Mark is also active in the field of digital humanities, developing projects that use free and open source software and conducting workshops on geovisualization techniques, project development, archival data collection, and music encoding practices.

Mark’s investigations in aesthetics and interpretation are informed by training in semiotics and semantics: in addition to MPhil and MA degrees in music from Columbia University, Mark holds a BA in linguistics with high honors from UC Berkeley and an MA in applied linguistics from&nbsp;UCLA.
